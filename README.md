# Kafka-R: Real-time Prediction

[![LinkedIn][linkedin-shield]][linkedin-url]

This tutorial explains how a machine learning model is applied on real-time data.
It predicts incoming data as well as the model is retrained when the prediction results decrease.
It focuses on simplicity and can be seen as a baseline for similar projects.
You can read more about it in my blog article:
[Apache Kafka and R: Real-Time Prediction and Model (Re)training](https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-baader-built-a-predictive-analytics-machine-learning-system-with-kafka-and-rstudio/).
